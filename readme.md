# JSON-ML Tools

This library is aimed at creating a set of tools to work with _JSON-ML_ in JavaScript. It is assumed that any JSON-ML (abbreviated JML) objects are compatible to the _non-compact_ JSON structure proposed by the [xml-js library](https://github.com/nashwaan/xml-js) to be fully convertible to and from XML documents including _mixed-content elements_.

## Usage
